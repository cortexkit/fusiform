//! The `catalog.get` route: turning a request into a catalog read.
//!
//! Kept separate from the daemon wiring so the request/response contract can be
//! tested without a socket. The daemon's handler is a thin adapter over
//! [`serve_catalog_get`].
//!
//! # What this layer decides, and what it refuses to guess at
//!
//! It parses a request, runs one read, and renders the result. It does not
//! interpret values: a rate that is `Unpriced(MissingRate)` travels as that, and
//! a limit the upstream stopped publishing travels as `null`. Every place this
//! layer could substitute a plausible value for a missing one is a place a
//! consumer would silently spend against a number fusiform invented.
//!
//! It also refuses to guess at a malformed request. An unparseable body, an
//! unknown source, an unreadable instant — each is an error naming what was
//! wrong, never a default read. A consumer that asked for the catalog at an
//! instant and received the current catalog would have no way to notice.
